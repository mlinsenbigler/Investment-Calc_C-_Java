Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Additional exception handling logic
Display alignment and formatting could be better

Did you find writing any piece of this code challenging, and how did you overcome this?
Working on a remote desktop and developing without working debugger tools in Eclipse. Developed code on local PC then uploaded to lab environment
Trying to set formatting correctly but spacing builds upon previous fields. Had to repeatedly adjust multiple column spacing formats

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
Language agnostic development
Debugging

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
By using industry standard best practices, this project is written with an eye toward collaboration. It employs the OOP design priciples of encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. And it is well commented throughout.
